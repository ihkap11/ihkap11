### Hi there 👋

I'm a machine learning engineer with 2 years of experience. I graduded with my Master's in AI from the University of Edinburgh in 2022, where I explored the potential of self-supervised learning techniques in learning from erroneous transcriptions. These techniques helped in training new ASR models with improved performance across various language and acoustic model configurations.

### 🌱 What I'm doing these days?
🌿 **Matchmaking and Ranking:** 

- Frustrated by League of Legend's matchmaking, I decided to start working on my own [game simulation engine](https://github.com/ihkap11/LeagueFanatics) and understand the matchmaking and ranking.
- I'm currently reading [_A Bayesian Approximation Method for Online Ranking_](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume12/weng11a/weng11a.pdf) by Weng and Lin.

🌿 **Open Source Contrutions:** 

- I'm helping with dashboard backend, resource organization, and platform optimization improving user experience @[FeatureForm](https://github.com/featureform/featureform), a virtual feature platform.
- I've recently started contributing to [HuggingFace/Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) and plan to make more contributions.



### 🔦 Previous work:
🔬 **Research**
- I researched speech scoring systems and used SHAP and PDP plots to study impact of inguistic cues on language proficiency [[IJAIED](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359250893_Automated_Speech_Scoring_System_Under_The_Lens_Evaluating_and_interpreting_the_linguistic_cues_for_language_proficiency)]
- Enhanced performance of Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) systems in my first job as ML engineer [[ACL](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-short.14/)]
