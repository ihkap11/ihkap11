### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a machine learning software engineer with experience in building data pipelines, training open-source models, and deploying them in production.
I grauduated with a Master's in AI from the University of Edinburgh (batch 2022), where I explored the potential of self-supervised learning techniques in learning from erroneous transcriptions. These techniques helped in training new ASR models with improved performance across various language and acoustic model configurations. 

I've mostly worked in speech and conversational AI, produced some research work [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7HfvNEcAAAAJ)],  and now I'm diverging to learning/solving problems like matchmaking and recommendations, LLMs, and ML lifecycle management toolings.
