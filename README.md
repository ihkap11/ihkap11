### Hi there 👋

I'm a machine learning engineer with 2 years of experience. I graduated with my Master's in AI from the University of Edinburgh in 2022, where I explored the potential of self-supervised learning techniques in learning from erroneous transcriptions. These techniques helped in training new ASR models with improved performance across various language and acoustic model configurations.

I've mostly worked in speech and conversational AI, produced some research work [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7HfvNEcAAAAJ)],  and now I'm diverging to learning/solving problems like matchmaking and recommendations, LLMs, and ML lifecycle management toolings.

####  What I'm doing these days?
🍃 **Game Simulation with Matchmaking and Ranking:** 

- Frustrated by League of Legend's matchmaking ⚔️, I decided to start working on my own [game simulation](https://github.com/ihkap11/LeagueFanatics) to understand  matchmaking and ranking algorithms, and eventually build a working software. 
- I'm currently reading [_A Bayesian Approximation Method for Online Ranking_](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume12/weng11a/weng11a.pdf) by Weng and Lin.

🌱 **Open Source Contrutions:** 

- I'm helping with dashboard backend, resource organization, and platform optimization improving user experience @[FeatureForm](https://github.com/featureform/featureform), the Virtual Feature Store. All with the kind mentorship from their wonderful team.




👯 I'm looking for new opportunity in Machine Learning, preferably around LLMs and ML lifecycle toolings. Reach out to me at bpakhi97@gmail.com.
